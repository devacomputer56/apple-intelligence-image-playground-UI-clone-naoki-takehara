This is a reproduction of the UI for the new Apple Intelligence feature, Image Playground. Note that it is only available on iOS 18 and above.

 The central section has an impressive gradient.

 At this stage (Feb 2025) it is still under development. If you have any bugs or comments, please share them with me!

 The code I have published is generic and can be used in various places.

 Note: This is a reproduction of the UI, not the functionality.
